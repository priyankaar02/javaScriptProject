/* ---------------------------------------------------------STATIC PROPERTY-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The static keyword in JavaScript is used inside a class to define methods or properties that belong to the class itself, rather than to instances of the class.

Key Points:

. Static methods are called directly on the class, not on instances.
. Static properties are also accessed via the class.
. Useful for utility functions, constants, and helper methods that donâ€™t need access to instance-specific data. */
